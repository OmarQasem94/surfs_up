## **Overview**
The purpose of this analysis was to utilize temperature data for June and December to consult an invester on wheather running a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round on the island of Oahu.

## **Results**

### June Temperture Statistics

### December Temperture Statistics

* June recorded a mean temperature of 75°F, which as expected was higher than December's 71°F.
* June recorde a minimum temperature of 64°F, while December recorded 56°F.
* June recorded a maximum temperature of 85°F, while December recorded 83°F.

## **Summary**
Comparing the June and December temperature statistics shows that both months have relatively close means recording 75°F and 74°F respectively. Maintaining a mean temperature close to 75°F year round means that the Island of Oahu is warm year round. However basing the analysis on temperature alone would omit a very important component, which is precipitation. Analyzing the precipitation statistics shows that June and December December recorded 0.14 and 0.22 inches of precipitation respectively. At these low levels of precipitation coupled with the warm temperature year round the Island of Ohau proves to be a feasible location for running a sustainable surf and ice cream shop year round.
